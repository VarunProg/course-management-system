# Project Description

## Course Management System API

This project is a RESTful API built with Express.js and TypeScript for a simple Course Management System. It provides endpoints to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) courses, allowing efficient management of course data. The API is connected to a MongoDB database for storing and retrieving course information.

### Features

- **Create New Courses:** Add new courses with details such as name, members, coach, and description.

- **Retrieve Course Data:** Fetch information about existing courses, including their details.

- **Update Course Information:** Modify course details as needed.

- **Delete Courses:** Remove courses from the system when they are no longer needed.

This API serves as the backend for a web application, enabling users to interact with the Course Management System, create new courses, update existing ones, and remove courses when necessary.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, and minimal web application framework for Node.js, used to create the API's endpoints and handle HTTP requests.

- **TypeScript:** A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and provides improved development experiences.

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database system that stores course data in a flexible, scalable, and schema-less format.

The combination of these technologies makes the Course Management System API efficient, maintainable, and adaptable to various use cases.

Please refer to the installation and configuration instructions in the README for details on setting up and running this project.


## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the backend server, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - The JavaScript runtime environment.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - The Node.js package manager.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - The NoSQL database system.

#### Navigate to the server directory:
1. cd server
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. keep it running for server api calls
